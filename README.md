# Artemis Online Coding Bootcamp

### What is Artemis?

Artemis is an online coding bootcamp & resource center for easily learning different programming languages and frameworks. Sometimes it can be extremely difficult to learn a new programming language, however, if you know one language it should be easy to learn another. 

The idea behind Artemis is to have a place where each language/framework you build the same applications. That way if you build one application using one language you now have an easy point of reference and comparison with another. 

Courses will range from simple HTML/CSS/JS --> Ruby on Rails --> Elixir --> Elm --> React --> VueJS. Hopefully, with support we can build an open community without any gate keepers to help new and seasoned pros quickly get up to speed with new languages, reducing the barrier to entry into each language.

The courses will consist of text/image based steps versus video courses. Trying to follow along while coding with a video course can be extermely difficult and annoying. Video courses also make it difficult to go back and reference information at a later date. 

At the time of writing this, it is very early stage with exteremly limited info.
